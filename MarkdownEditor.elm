module MarkdownEditor where
-- Elm’s "import" keyword works mostly like "require" in node.js.
-- The “exposing (..)” option specifies that we want to bring the Html module’s contents
-- into this file’s current namespace, so that instead of writing out
-- Html.form and Html.label we can just use "form" and "label" without the "Html." prefix.
import Html exposing(...)
-- This works the same way; we also want to import the entire
-- Html.Events module into the current namespace.
import Html.Events exposing (..)
-- With this import we are only bringing a few specific functions into our
-- namespace, specifically "id", "type'", "for", "value", and "class".
import Html.Attributes exposing (id, type', for, value, class)
